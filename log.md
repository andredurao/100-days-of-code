# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 01, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created repos to develop the examples of "Building Web Apps with Go" codegangsta's book, added the book's first example a file server written in go. [Repo](https://github.com/andredurao/building-web-apps-with-go.git)

**Thoughts:** This is my first day, so I'll keep up reading the book and implementing the examples
